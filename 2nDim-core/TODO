    - think about using uniform blocks for distributing the projection as well as the camera matrix to every shader at once.
    - add batch rendering in some form. i think this could give speed a nice improvement :)
    - improve documentation
    - replace some ugly code fragments. Mostly marked with //todo or //fixme
    - think about multithreading the update and render parts

    - Implement a sprite and an animated sprite class
    - Implement tile mapping

    - What about shadows
    - What about lighting

    - UI?

    - We also need some Sound
    - and some Music playback possibilities

    - A Particle system would also be kinda nice
    - the same goes for animations
