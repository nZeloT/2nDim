# 2nDim

The beginning of a very simple and most basic 2D Game Engine in Java using LWJGL3 for rendering and dyn4j for physics. Enjoy :)
Everything stil is under heavy construction. Expect things to change a lot. Not feature complete at all.

## Build instructions

The given maven buildfiles should do their job. ;) They also provide you with a ready to run "sandbox.jar".

## License

Everything goes under MIT License. Except the code within the "third.party" package.
