# 2nDim

The beginning of a very simple and most basic 2D Game Engine in Java using LWJGL3 for rendering and dyn4j for physics. Enjoy :)

Everything stil is under heavy construction. Expect things to change a lot. Not feature complete at all.

## Why?

I just wanted to challenge my self if i could finish such a project. Additionally i thought that alternatives like libGDX are far to
fat for what i need. I wanted a simple, easy and streamlined little engine. Handling almost every bit of the boilerplate code
which is necessary for a game.

## Goals

Build a somewhat high level API around OpenGL by at the same time leaving enough power to the user to do what ever he wants.
The API is ought to be easy and self explaining.

## Build instructions

The given maven buildfiles should do their job. ;) They also provide you with a ready to run "sandbox.jar".
Just type in:
```mvn package```

## License

Everything goes under MIT License. Except the code within the "third.party" package.
